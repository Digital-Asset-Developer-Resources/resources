Contributing to Resources
=========================

There are many ways to help improve this resource for yourself and others, and we urge you to consider lending some assistance to continue making this project better.

Useful ways to contribute include

* Spinning up a node and letting us know how long it takes for it to sync with the blockchain, including information such as what image you used, the image's current block, and your machine configurations.

* Bug reports, as well as other difficulties encountered when setting up a node.

* Improvements to the code for setting up a network or image.

* Setting up information and code for a coin not currently covered by this resource, following the general template laid out in this repository, is extremely helpful.

* Similarly, helping to expand access to other cloud based services which can host images/snapshots for use when setting up a node.

* Monetary donations to cover the server costs of maintaining the images are also appreciated.


Thank you for you interest in contributing to this resource.
