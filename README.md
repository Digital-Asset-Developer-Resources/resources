Blockchain Resources
====================

What problem are we solving?
----------------------------

Comparisons of platforms (coins), distributed applications (tokens)
and their capabilities is missing from the crypto-currency and digital
asset space.  Most projects require some level of software engineering
skills, limiting their accessibility to a wider audience.

Why do we care?
---------------

Developers face steep learning curve and uncertainty in selecting the
best platform for their use case.  Business needs intelligence on
competitive projects.

What this project does
----------------------

This repo provides the bare minimum to set up cloud resources and sync
a blockchain from either the genesis block or from an already synched
blockchain.  We abstract away the environment requirements using
standardized cloud services.  Further we provide standardized
configuration files, set-up scripts and server configurations.  

Our goals are to provide:

1. Minimal resources to launch a server from a cloud based service.

2. Reproducible.  This project is not seeking to become a trusted
source, but rather a reproducible resource for developers to quickly
move up the learning curve.

3. Standard environment.  Provide a small number of environment
variables, system services and set-up scripts common to all
blockchains.

4. Shorten learning curve.  Removing some of the common software
engineering tasks and providing synched blockchains allows developer
to focus on the features of each project.

5. Comparable features.  Provide comparative statistics, installed
scaffolding, tools including command line interface links, links to
SDKs and some common, simple capabilities (tokens, smart contracts,
etc.)
